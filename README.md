### Author's comments

I opted to implement message submissions with the return key instead of with a submission button, since I felt this to be a cleaner (and more common) user experience.  Apart from that, the code should be pretty straight forward for those familiar with the React framework.  If there's interest, I'd be happy to add documentation regarding how each component functions within the App as a whole.
